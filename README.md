# HIIII WELCOME IN!! ^^
This is gonna be my place to put just about everything I do in terms of websites and coding! ~~I feel like that's a given?~~

I'm Bailey, though you can also call me Jay! I like to play around with HTML and CSS to make static websites, though I am (somewhat) trying to learn JavaScript as well! I usually know enough to do what I want to do, but there's still lots for me to learn. I've been toying with personal websites for about two years now, and you can look [here](https://baileylockheart.github.io) to see what I've made so far!

I definitely over-rely on social media, as many do, but I still have a special place in my heart for personal websites and the freedom/creativity that they allow! Because of that, I've made quite a few! My most recent one, [lockheartlove](https://lockheartlove.netlify.app), is intended as a internet brain dump. It's meant for my interests and collections of fun things, and I'm actively looking for more things to add to it! I like looking around on Neocities and clicking through webrings, and I also enjoy looking through my mutuals' carrds/rentrys/strawpages if they have them! Generally speaking, I love the idea of an indie web revival, even if I'm not old enough to get nostalgia from it. I'd like to have some fun in my corner of the internet, and also witness the creativity that others can express in theirs!
