- 👋 Hi, I’m @baileylockheart, although on most socials, I'm @bailey_lockheart! (The underscore is important to me but it's not allowed everywhere ㅠㅠ)
- 👀 I’m interested in front end web development, I think? I make lots of little websites and spend a lot of my time toying around with HTML and CSS, more than anything else. Also, I'm a singer-songwriter! I love songwriting, and I've already published <a href="https://snd.click/lxxz" target="_blank">my first EP</a>, although I don't know exactly how relevant that is here 😅
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML and CSS, as I said - I know enough to make what I want to make, but I want to learn more. Also, I'm trying (and vaguely failing) to learn Javascript, but I'm taking my time to get really good with the first two.
- 💞️ I’m not particularly interested in collaborations, so much as I want to look around, see what people are up to, and learn along the way! Once I'm confident enough in what I do to think I could participate in a project without messing it up, this may change.
- 📫 Like I said, I'm @bailey_lockheart on most socials! That includes Instagram and Discord, which is where it'd be best to DM me if you wanna talk :)
